        <h2>A timeline of Albert Einstein most notable achievements:</h2>
        <ul id="tribute-info">
            <li><strong>1879:</strong> Born on March 14 in Ulm, Germany.</li>
            <li><strong>1900:</strong> Graduated from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich with a teaching diploma in
                mathematics and physics.</li>
            <li><strong>1905:</strong> Published four groundbreaking papers in <em>"Annalen der Physik"</em>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1909:</strong> Appointed associate professor at the University of Zurich.</li>
            <li><strong>1911:</strong> Became a full professor at the German University in Prague. Predicted the bending
                of light by gravity, later confirmed during a solar eclipse.</li>
            <li><strong>1913:</strong> Returned to Germany as a professor at the University of Berlin and became a
                member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.</li>
            <li><strong>1915:</strong> Published the <em>Theory of Relativity</em>, redefining gravity as the curvature
                of spacetime.
            <li><strong>1919:</strong> Theory confirmed during a solar eclipse, making Einstein an international
                celebrity.</li>
            <li><strong>1921:</strong> Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the photoelectric effect, not for
                relativity.</li>
            <li><strong>1922:</strong> Began worldwide lecture tours, spreading his ideas globally.</li>
            <li><strong>1933:</strong> Fled Nazi Germany and settled in Princeton, New Jersey, working at the Institute
                for Advanced Study.</li>
            <li><strong>1939:</strong> Co-signed a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning about Nazi
                Germanyâ€™s potential nuclear weapons development, influencing the creation of the Manhattan Project.</li>
            <li><strong>1945:</strong> Advocated against the use of nuclear weapons following their deployment in
                Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</li>
            <li><strong>1950:</strong> Published the <em>"Unified Field Theory,"</em> attempting to unify the forces of
                nature, though it was incomplete.</li>
            <li><strong>1955:</strong> Died on April 18 in Princeton, New Jersey, leaving behind a monumental scientific
                legacy.</li>
            <li><strong>2013:</strong> shares the Nobel Prize in Physics with Francois Englebert "for the theoretical
                discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic
                particles".</li>

            <q>Einstein was not only a great theoretical physicist, but he also had a clear vision of the role of
                physics in the modern world.</q>
